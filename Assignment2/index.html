          <h2>ðŸ‘½Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)</h2>
          <p>UFOs, or <b>Unidentified Flying Objects</b>, refer to any <u>aerial phenomena or objects in the sky</u> that cannot be readily identified or explained by 
            conventional means. They are often associated with reports of sightings of <u>unexplained or mysterious flying craft</u> and have been the subject of speculation, 
            investigation, and debate regarding their origin and nature.</p>
          <p><b>Here is an overview of the number of UFOs reported in the last decade by each country.</b></p>

          <p>In the <b>last decade (Since 1 Jan 2012)</b>, a significant number of UFO sightings have been reported across a wide range of countries. 
            The data reveals that the <b>United States of America</b> stands out with a remarkable <u>65,114 reported sightings</u>, signifying a strong interest in <b>UFO phenomena</b>. 
            Additionally, several other nations, including <b>Canada, India, Russia, and multiple European countries</b>, have also documented a substantial number of UFO sightings. 
            This global distribution of sightings highlights the widespread curiosity and attention surrounding unidentified flying objects, reflecting their enduring 
            presence in public consciousness.</p>

          <h2>ðŸ›¸ UFOs around the clock!</h2>
          <p>The <b>University of Virginia</b> segregated USA's UFO sightings in the past decade and analyzed when UFOs were most visible in the sky.</p>
          <p>The overall trend of sightings indicates that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Total Number of Sightings:</b> 65,114</li>
            <li><b>Hour with the Highest Number of Sightings:</b> 11pm with 10,583 sightings</li>
            <li><b>Hour with the Lowest Number of Sightings:</b> 4pm with 4 sightings</li>

          <h2>ðŸ›¸ What shape is a UFO?</h2>
          <p>In a comprehensive analysis of reported UFO sightings, various shapes were documented, with <b>circles</b> and <b>triangles</b> being the most frequently observed, totaling <u>27,093</u> and <u>19,416 sightings</u>, respectively. The data also included <b>cigar-shaped</b>, <b>egg-shaped</b>, <b>diamond-shaped</b>, <b>rectangular</b>, and <b>disc-shaped</b> UFOs, with varying levels of confidence in their identification. Notably, <b>fireball</b> and <b>disc</b> UFOs had high confidence levels of <u>0.78</u> and <u>0.81</u>, respectively. Additionally, a category labeled <b>other shapes</b> accounted for <u>9,932</u> sightings.</p>

          <h2>ðŸ›¸ Military Surveillance</h2>
          <p>Military surveillance encompasses the systematic monitoring and observation activities conducted by armed forces to gather intelligence, maintain situational awareness, and enhance security through various technologies and methods, including satellites, drones, reconnaissance aircraft, and ground-based sensors.</p>
          <p>UFOs can come under military surveillance when they are detected or reported within a military's operational area or airspace. Military organizations have radar systems, sensors, and personnel trained to monitor and investigate aerial threats or anomalies, which may include UFO sightings.</p>

          <p>The data <b>highlights</b> the <u>discrepancy in expenditures on UFO surveillance and military powerhouses</u>. While some countries invest heavily in 
            their military and related activities, the allocation of resources for UFO surveillance and investigation <b>varies significantly</b>. </p>

          <h2>ðŸ›¸ In conclusion</h2>
          <p>It's worth noting that UFO surveillance and investigation are <b>not</b> a standard or <u>primary component of military spending</u> for most countries, 
            and the allocation of resources for such purposes is generally low in comparison to broader defense and security expenses. </p>
          <p>Whether this changes in the 
            future may depend on evolving priorities and interests, as well as advancements in technology and public interest in the subject.</p>
